# Multiple Imputation

## Motivation

When dealing with missing values, a knee-jerk reaction would be to delete missing observations altogether. In this dataset, deleting observaations with missing values would remove more than 80% of the dataset, which is troubling. Else, we might remove columns containing missing values altogether, but you might end up removing important information.
