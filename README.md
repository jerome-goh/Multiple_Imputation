# Missing Data Analysis & Multiple Imputation

## Motivation

When dealing with missing values, a knee-jerk reaction would be to delete missing observations altogether. In this dataset, deleting observations with missing values would remove more than 80% of the dataset, which is troubling. Otherwise, we might remove columns containing missing values altogether, but you might remove important information for your model.


This project focuses on identifying and understanding how missing variables are "similarly missing" and exploring the correlation between the parameters with missing values and parameters with non-missing values, such that the most suitable prior information can be used for the imputation model
